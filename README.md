# Game Mandem


A cycle-accurate emulator for the Game Boy. Currently is a work in progress, please mind the mess at the moment.

To make up for this, I drew Miyamoto as a cat. Hope this is sufficient restitution.

## Instructions

As of now, you need to be on a Mac that has SDL2 installed in the library folder for it to run. You can probably tinker around with the makefile pretty easily to get it running on your system, however.

Setup:

make

./gameboy romFilename debugArg

Controls:
x = A button
z = B button
backspace = Select button
enter/return = Start button

Directional buttons use the directional buttons on the keyboard.
